Homework

Info note for this homework:

Big O gives the upperbound - the worst possible execution time of an algorithm. And Ω is the converse of O, ie, the lowest estimate. Θ is somewhere inbetween. More info: Link to an article

Task 1. What is the expected running time of the following C# code? Explain why.

Assume the array's size is n.
long Compute(int[] arr)
{
    long count = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<arr.Length; i++)    // This would take n operation before finish
    {                                   // From zero to n
        int start = 0, end = arr.Length-1;
        while (start < end)             // This will perform n-1 operations
            if (arr[start] < arr[end])  
                { start++; count++; }
            else 
                end--;
    }
    return count;
}
Answer to task 1

The complexity of the code would be 0(n^2) (quadratic time).

Task 2. What is the expected running time of the following C# code?

Explain why.
Assume the input matrix has size of n * m.
long CalcCount(int[,] matrix)
{
    long count = 0;
    for (int row=0; row<matrix.GetLength(0); row++) // The operation will perform n times
        if (matrix[row, 0] % 2 == 0)
            for (int col=0; col<matrix.GetLength(1); col++) // The operation will perform m times
                if (matrix[row,col] > 0)                    // In worst case scenario
                    count++;
    return count;
}
Answer to task 2

The complexity of the code would be O(n*m) (quadratic time).

Task 3.* What is the expected running time of the following C# code?

Explain why.
Assume the input matrix has size of n * m.
long CalcSum(int[,] matrix, int row)
{
    long sum = 0;
    for (int col = 0; col < matrix.GetLength(0); col++) // The operation will perform m times
        sum += matrix[row, col];
    if (row + 1 < matrix.GetLength(1)) 
        sum += CalcSum(matrix, row + 1);  // The operation will perform n times
    return sum;
}

Console.WriteLine(CalcSum(matrix, 0));
Answer to task 3

The complexity of the code would be O(n*m) (quadratic time).
